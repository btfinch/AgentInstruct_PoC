Ok now I want to start making a basic interface for assessing how the agents are processing data. This interface will be a simple web app where:

1. You randomly select data from the data set to use
2. You can select which transformation agent you want to use. Then you can see what the original data is converted into. 
3. You can select which instruction generation agent you want to use. Then you can see what instructions are generated. 
4. You can see the the output of the sugestor agent
5. You can see what the editor agent outputs as the final q a pair.
